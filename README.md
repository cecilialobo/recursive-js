# JavaScript Recursive Function

- A recursive function is a function that calls itself until it doesnâ€™t (condition to stop), this is called recursion.

To remember: 
1. think about the "base case" - where to start.
2. Create a condition - if - to stop based on the "base case".
3. Create a case that converts the function to the "base case" - calling the function inside itself.
